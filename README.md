PyWO - Python Window Organizer
===========

[Note my code see th original repo](https://code.google.com/p/pywo/)


Introduction
------------
PyWO allows you to easily organize windows on the desktop using keyboard shortcuts. It's inspired by Quicktile, Compiz plugins: Grid, Put, and Maximumize.

Features:
-----------
* Move window in any direction and snap it to other windows' edges
* Resize (expand or shrink) window in any direction
* Place window in predefined places on the desktop
* Use grid-like layout (place window and cycle predefined sizes)
* Switch windows' positions
* Highly customizable

Download
-------------
Download archive with PyWO-0.2 for stable version.

Checkout project's Subversion repository for development version (/trunk folder). This version contains latest features and bugfixes, but I can't guarantee that it will be stable!

Requirements
------------
You need Python 2.5 or higher with [python-xlib](http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/) module installed (on Ubuntu you need to install python-xlib package).

PyWO works with (or at least should work with) any EWMH compliant window manager.

Seems to work OK (or almost OK) with:

* Compiz (tested with 0.7.8, and 0.8.4) (does not work with 0.9.x used by Unity)
* Metacity (tested with 2.24 and 2.30.1)
* KDE (KWin) (tested with 4.3.0)
* XFCE (Xfwm4) (tested with 4.6.1)
* Enlightment (e16) (tested with 1.0.0)
* Openbox (tested with 3.4.10)
* FVWM (tested with 2.5.28)

In 0.2 version there are problems with:

* Blackox (tested with 0.70.1), IceWM (tested with 1.36) - no support for _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS, but I should be able to write a hack to get borders' size anyway (fixed in development version)
* Fluxbox (tested with 1.1.1), WindowMaker - window is moved 1px (to right and bottom) too far, not sure why... (fixed in development version)
* Sawfish (tested with 1.3.5.2) - (fixed in development version)
* pekwm (tested with 0.1.11) - some strange behaviour (fixed in development version)
* JWM - some strange behaviour
* Afterstep - _NET_WORKAREA returns None

Development version works OK with GNOME 3 (Mutter)

Usage
----------
Just run ./pywo.py

Create ~/.pyworc file to configure PyWO. Read [PyWO Configuration](https://code.google.com/p/pywo/wiki/PywoConfiguration) for reference. Defaults can be found in pyworc file. You can choose one of the predefined grid layouts: 2x2, 3x2 (default), 3x3, or define your own.

PyWO creates /tmp/PyWO.log file where all debugging informations are logged.

**Default keyboard shortcuts:**

```
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-Q    - exit PyWO
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-R    - reload configuration file
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-I    - print debug information about window manager and current window

Alt-KP_Divide       - switch windows (change position of the window)
Alt-Shift-KP_Divide - cycle windows (change contents of the window)

Alt-KP_1-9          - move window in a direction (KP_1-9 - numpad keys)
Shift-KP_1-9        - expand window in a direction (5 works as maximumize compiz plugin)
Alt-Shift-KP_1-9    - shrink window
Alt-Ctrl-KP_1-9     - put window to predefined position
Ctrl_KP_1-9         - put and resize (grid), and cycle widths
Ctrl-Shift_KP_1-9   - put and resize (grid), and cycle heights
```
Cycle/Switch - press keyboard shortcut and select other window (using Alt-Tab, or using mouse). If you want to cancel switch/cycle press again the keyboard shortcut

Known bugs
-----------
* shrinking with MIDDLE direction is not always working as expected
* windows set to appear on all desktops can cause some problems (fixed in development version)
* problems with windows with border_width > 0

TODO
----------
* ~~keyboard setting for laptop users (withou keypad) - maybe vim like HJKL, or UIOJKLM<>?~~
* Undo feature
* test with more than one monitor connected - if you want to help me with multi monitor support please send me output of this script - it will check diplays, screens, resolutions
* more settings for move and expand actions
* ~~prepare for easy_install (implemented in development version)~~
* ~~use pkg_resources and entry_points for plugins system (implemented in development version)~~
* snap only to visible windows only (skip windows that are covered by others)
* unit testing (in progress)
* ~~add D-Bus communication (implemented in development version)~~
